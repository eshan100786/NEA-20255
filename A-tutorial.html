      <h2>Teacher Mode Tutorial</h2>
      <p>
        This mode is designed to assist teachers in explaining math concepts
        to students in a classroom setting. Here's how it works: <br /><br />
        Select a Topic: Begin by selecting a topic from the available options:
        multiplication, algebra, geometry, or quadratics. Each topic will
        present a structured question format to help facilitate teaching.
        <br /><br />
        Question Structure: Upon selecting a topic, you'll be presented with a
        structured question format tailored to that specific area of math. For
        example:
        <br /><br />
        In Quadratics, you'll encounter equations of the form axÂ² + bx + c =
        0. You can edit the values of a, b, and c, and then press the "Solve"
        button to find the solutions. In Algebra, you might encounter
        equations of the form x + a - b = c. You can adjust the values of a,
        b, and c, and then solve for x. <br><br>Canvas for Demonstrations: The bottom
        half of the screen features a canvas where you can visually
        demonstrate how to solve a question to your students. This can be
        particularly helpful for illustrating problem-solving steps or
        demonstrating mathematical concepts.
        <br /><br />
        Topic Change: On the left side of the screen, you'll find a "Topic
        Change" button. This allows you to switch between different topics at
        any time, providing flexibility in lesson planning and instruction.
        <br /><br />
        This mode empowers teachers to engage students effectively by
        providing structured questions, interactive demonstrations, and
        flexibility in topic selection. It's a valuable tool for enhancing
        math instruction in the classroom.

      <h2>Student Mode Tutorial</h2>
      <p>
        In Student Mode, you'll have the opportunity to test your math skills
        and track your progress. Here's how it works: <br /><br />
        Enter Your Name: Start by entering your name in the provided field.
        This will personalize your experience and allow you to track your
        performance.
        <br /><br />
        Pick a Topic: Choose a topic from the available options. Each topic
        contains three questions tailored to that specific area of math.
        <br /><br />
        Answer Questions: Once you've selected a topic, you'll be presented
        with three questions related to that topic. Use your math skills to
        solve each question to the best of your ability.
        <br /><br />
        Track Your Score: Your score will be displayed on the left side of the
        screen at all times. As you answer questions correctly, your score
        will increase. This score will determine your grade at the end of the
        session.
        <br /><br />
        Workout Area: Below the question section, there's a canvas where you
        can work out your solutions or use it to jot down any notes.
        Alternatively, you can also work out in your book.
        <br /><br />
        Finish and Grade: Once you've completed the questions for a topic,
        instead of moving to the next topic, you'll press "Finish". Your grade
        will be determined based on the number of questions you've answered
        correctly. Grades range from A to F.
